MANUAL VERCEL REBUILD GUIDE
===========================

If Vercel didn't auto-rebuild, do this:

OPTION 1: Manual Rebuild from Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
========================================================

1. Open: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. Click: "prop" project

3. Go to: "Deployments" tab

4. Find: Latest deployment (should say "Failed" with schema error)

5. Click: The deployment to open details

6. Look for: "Redeploy" or "Rebuild" button

7. Click: "Redeploy" button

8. Wait: 3-5 minutes for build to complete

9. Check: Status should change to "Ready" ✅


OPTION 2: Force Rebuild with Empty Commit
===========================================

1. Make an empty commit:
   $ cd /Users/eaklovyachawla/prop
   $ git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger rebuild"

2. Push to GitHub:
   $ git push origin main

3. Vercel will detect and rebuild

4. Check progress at: https://vercel.com/dashboard


OPTION 3: Check Build Logs
===========================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. Click: "prop" project

3. Click: "Deployments" tab

4. Click: Latest failed deployment

5. Scroll down: Look for error details

6. Read: What the error says

Common errors:
- "DATABASE_URL not set" → Add to Vercel env vars
- "Build failed" → Check package.json
- "Schema validation failed" → vercel.json syntax error


WHAT TO LOOK FOR
================

After rebuild, you should see:
✅ Status: "Ready" (green)
✅ All checks: Passed
✅ No errors in log

If still failing:
❌ Check vercel.json syntax (JSON validator)
❌ Check DATABASE_URL in environment variables
❌ Check .env file (shouldn't be in git)


VERCEL.JSON FIX CONFIRMED
=========================

✅ vercel.json has been fixed
✅ Pushed to GitHub: commit 13bcebb
✅ Ready for Vercel to rebuild

Just need Vercel to detect the change!
